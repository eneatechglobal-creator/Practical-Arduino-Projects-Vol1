**🛠️ Practical Arduino Projects (Volume 1)**
Official Resource Hub by Avishkar Gandhi & Evaan Gandhi

Welcome to the official source code repository for our 392-page guide. This repository is designed to help you move beyond the basics and master the art of iterative systems engineering.

**📂 How this Repository is Organized**
Each folder matches the Core Projects found in the book:

CP1 - CP11: Core project folders.

Versions A, B, C, D: Inside each project folder, you will find the iterative versions (e.g., CP1VA_F).

.ino Files: Every version is contained within its own required sketch folder to ensure it opens perfectly in the Arduino IDE.

**🚀 How to Use These Files**
Download Everything: Click the green "<> Code" button at the top of this page and select "Download ZIP".

Extract: Unzip the folder on your computer.

Open: Navigate to the project and version you are studying in the book.

Upload: Double-click the .ino file to open it in the Arduino IDE and upload it to your board.
